# Attendance and participation

While attendance does not contribute directly to your grade, active participation is strongly encouraged and integral to your course success.
Regular class attendance offers several benefits:

1.  Enhanced understanding of course material through engaging discussions;
2.  Opportunities for collaborative learning through group activities;
3.  Practical application of concepts via hands-on exercises.

Please note that while it is possible to achieve the maximum number of points without attending lectures, consistent attendance demonstrates commitment to the course.
This commitment may be considered when addressing individual circumstances or requests for flexibility.

!!! warning "Important"
    Virtual attendance (e.g., via Zoom) is unavailable for this course.
    All class sessions will be conducted in person.
