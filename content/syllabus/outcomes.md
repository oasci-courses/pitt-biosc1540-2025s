# Outcomes

There are only two required courses in the [Bachelor's degree in computational biology](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/computational-biology) where learning computational biology is the focus.
After this course, students must take computational genomics (BIOSC 1542) or simulation and modeling (BIOSC 1544).
Outcomes for this course are geared towards introducing students to both subfields.

1.  Understand the fundamental concepts and methodologies in genomics, transcriptomics, and computational structural biology.
2.  Recognize the applications of computational methods in various biological fields.
3.  Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of different computational approaches in biology.
4.  Interpret and analyze results from various computational biology methods.
5.  Demonstrate enhanced problem-solving and critical thinking skills in the context of computational biology.
