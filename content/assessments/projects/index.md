!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

These projects aim to mimic the research process of discovering novel antibiotics, giving students hands-on experience with key bioinformatics, molecular simulations, and computer-aided drug design tools used in early-stage drug discovery.

## Learning objectives

By completing this project, students will:

-   Gain practical experience with a complete CADD workflow.
-   Understand how genomic data informs drug target selection.
-   Learn to use and interpret results from state-of-the-art structure prediction tools.
-   Develop skills in molecular docking and virtual screening.
-   Critically analyze results at each stage of the drug discovery pipeline.
