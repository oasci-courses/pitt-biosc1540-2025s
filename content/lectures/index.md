# Lectures

To support incremental learning and minimize cognitive overload, this course is organized into two complementary types of lectures each week.

## Foundations (Tuesdays)

Tuesday lectures lay the groundwork for each topic by introducing key concepts, contextualizing the material within the broader field of computational biology, and exploring its practical applications.
These sessions emphasize:

-   **Conceptual understanding**: Building a clear understanding of the topic's fundamental principles.
-   **Real-world relevance**: Demonstrating how the topic applies to research, industry, or problem-solving in biology.
-   **Practical insights**: Discussing examples, challenges, and tools related to the subject matter.

Students are encouraged to engage in discussions and reflect on how these foundations will inform the computational methods covered later in the week.

## Methodology (Thursdays)

Thursday lectures focus on the computational side of each topic, providing hands-on experience with the tools, algorithms, and coding techniques used in the field.
These sessions emphasize:

-   **Algorithmic and methodological details**: Explaining the underlying computational techniques and workflows.
-   **Python-based implementation**: Writing and analyzing code to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems.
-   **Problem-solving skills**: Guiding students through practical exercises to reinforce learning and develop proficiency in computational tools.

By separating foundational knowledge from technical implementation, this structure allows students to engage deeply with each aspect of the material while ensuring that concepts and skills build upon one another.

## Why this structure?

This two-part weekly approach is designed to:

-   Minimize cognitive overload by focusing on different aspects of the material in distinct sessions.
-   Foster a stronger connection between theory and practice by bridging foundational knowledge with hands-on computation.
-   Equip students with both the conceptual framework and technical skills needed to succeed in computational biology.

Students are expected to review material from both sessions and complete assignments that integrate foundational concepts with computational applications.
