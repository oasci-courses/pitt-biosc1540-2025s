    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

This session provides the conceptual framework for understanding modern DNA sequencing technologies and the importance of quality control in genomic data analysis.
Students will explore the principles underlying sequencing techniques and file formats.

## Learning objectives

After today, you should have a better understanding of:

1.  Steps involved in DNA preparation for sequencing.
2.  General experimental workflow for DNA sequencing.
3.  Evolution and principles of DNA sequencing technologies.
4.  Overview of major sequencing platforms.
5.  Role of quality control in sequencing experiments.

<!-- Notes

- Add example about cluster for why we need stronger signal.
- Need to go into more detail/clarification of primers, indices, and adapters.
- There seems to be a gap in how we get from sample, to attached, amplified, and then sequenced.
- Gave example of looking out into a dark stadium and giving people flash lights.
- Students are still really struggling with how the fragments get onto the flow cell.
