Thoughts:

-   I was short about 15 minutes; maybe I was going to fast.
-   Some students said the career portion was helpful.
-   Essentially no questions.
-   Could go more in depth on the materials?
-   Probably should have mentioned brush up on fundamentals, or even gave a quick crash course to start next class.
-   Having the career at the beginning was weird, but useful.
-   People were very glad that coding was taken out of this class.
-   Definitely think that Python should be in replace of the special interests lectures.
