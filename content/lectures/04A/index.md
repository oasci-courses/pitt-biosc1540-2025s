This lecture covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of gene annotation, a critical process in genomics for identifying and characterizing genes within DNA sequences.
We'll explore various computational methods used in gene annotation, their applications, and challenges.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

1.  Define gene annotation and describe its key components.
2.  Outline the main computational methods used in gene prediction and annotation.
3.  Analyze and interpret basic gene annotation data and outputs.

## Supplementary material
