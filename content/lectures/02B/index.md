    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

This session focuses on the practical steps and computational tools required for analyzing sequencing data.
Students will engage in hands-on activities using Python and Galaxy to process sequencing datasets, assess data quality, and clean reads for downstream analyses.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Interpret the structure of FASTA and FASTQ files, including their role in sequencing data storage.
2.  Write Python scripts to parse FASTQ files, calculate quality scores, and filter low-quality reads.
3.  Analyze sequencing data quality using FastQC in Galaxy and interpret the resulting reports.
4.  Apply read trimming and filtering techniques using Galaxy tools like fastp.

## Readings

Relevant content for today's lecture.

<!-- NOTE:

-   This was too much material to cover in one lecture.
-   N50 and L50 were confusing concepts
-   Probably spend too much time on why we use ASCII or error source. I could streamline this.
-   Perhaps I can have students be responsible for that material for more activity time.
